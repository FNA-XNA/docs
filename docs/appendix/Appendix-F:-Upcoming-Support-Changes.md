# Appendix F: Upcoming Support Changes

While very rare, FNA does occasionally make changes to its support matrix, usually to migrate existing platforms to new system requirements or development environments. In extremely rare cases, certain features may even be removed from FNA. This page is meant to track the more extreme cases, so that developers can plan their own products' development accordingly.

## glibc Support Calendar

As of February 2025, FNA requires glibc 2.31 or newer. The fnalibs build OS is [Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (Sniper)](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/sniper/sdk).

There are currently no plans o update the glibc requirement at this time.
